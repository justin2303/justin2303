👋 Hi, I’m @justin2303  
I am a Compsci student at UC Davis. I don't usually work on projects during school (as I've had to catch up pretty hard as a previously Electrical engineering major).  
However, when I do, I tend to do projects for an online gaming community I am part of called the 61e. We are a mount and blade napoleonic wars regiment :)  

👀 I’m interested in learning fullstack things. I've worked with Flask, Django, and want to expand that further.  

🌱 I’m currently learning Next.js. I plan to do a database + webapp project this summer, where Next.js will play a big role.    

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... uhh not sure 😅 Not really many people play Mount and Blade Napoleonic Wars, or have similar interests, so I doubt anyone would wanna work on my projects :)  


⚡ Fun fact: I used to play piano quite well, with what little practice I can get nowadays, I still can play Mozart Turkish march and Sonata K281 pretty well 🤡
