ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @justin2303  
I am a Compsci student at UC Davis. Currently I'm working on a fullstack project for a Social/administrative web app for the group of people who come to the NA linebattles in Mount and Blade: Napoleonic Wars.
It consists of a Go backend and a React.js frontend, split across 2 repos.
I hope to finish this by December 2024.
Thank you for reading this!
